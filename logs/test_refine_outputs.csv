1,What is the square root of 256?,Sufficient,The square root of 256 is 16.,0
1,Explain how photosynthesis occurs.,Sufficient,Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. It takes place in chloroplasts using chlorophyll. The overall reaction is: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂.,0
1,Define natural selection.,Sufficient,Natural selection is the process by which organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. It is a key mechanism of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin.,0
1,What are the three states of matter?,Sufficient,Solid, liquid, gas,0
1,Explain the water cycle.,Sufficient,The water cycle involves processes like evaporation (water turning to vapor), condensation (vapor turning into clouds), precipitation (rain/snow), and collection (water returning to oceans/lakes). It is a continuous process driven by the sun.,0
1,What causes day and night?,Needs improvement,Day and night are caused by Earth's rotation on its axis. As Earth rotates, different parts face the Sun (day) or move away from it (night).,1
2,What causes day and night?,Needs improvement,The Earth spins on its axis, completing one rotation roughly every 24 hours. This rotation causes different parts of the Earth to face the Sun or be in shadow, resulting in day and night.,1
3,What causes day and night?,Needs improvement,Day and night occur due to Earth's rotation on its axis. This causes different regions to face the Sun or be turned away, creating the cycle of daylight and darkness.,1
1,Define biodiversity.,Sufficient,Biodiversity refers to the variety of life in all its forms, levels, and combinations, including ecosystem diversity, species diversity, and genetic diversity.,0
1,What is the powerhouse of the cell?,Sufficient,The mitochondrion is known as the powerhouse of the cell because it produces energy in the form of ATP through cellular respiration.,0

1,Largest planet in solar system?,Sufficient,Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system.,0
1,Define ecosystem.,Sufficient,An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and their non-living environment in a specific area.,0
1,Boiling point of water in Celsius?,Sufficient,The boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure is 100 degrees Celsius.,0
1,Define gravity.,Sufficient,Gravity is a natural force of attraction between two masses. On Earth, it gives weight to physical objects and causes them to fall toward the ground.,0
1,Longest mountain range?,Sufficient,The Andes is the longest continental mountain range in the world, stretching along the western edge of South America.,0
1,Basic unit of life?,Sufficient,The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms.,0
1,Primary function of the brain?,Needs improvement,The brain processes sensory information, controls motor functions, and coordinates thought, emotion, and memory.,1
2,Primary function of the brain?,Needs improvement,The primary function of the brain is to serve as the control center of the body. It processes sensory information, initiates responses, stores memories, and coordinates bodily functions.,1
3,Primary function of the brain?,Needs improvement,The brain is responsible for processing information, regulating body functions, enabling thought and emotions, and facilitating communication within the nervous system.,1
1,Term for animals eating plants & animals?,Sufficient,Omnivores are animals that eat both plants and other animals.,0
1,Define climate change.,Sufficient,Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels.,0
